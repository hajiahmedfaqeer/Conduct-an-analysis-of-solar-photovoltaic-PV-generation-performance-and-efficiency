**Conduct-an-analysis-of-solar-photovoltaic-PV-generation-performance-and-efficiency**
This project analyzes solar panel performance data to understand power generation trends, visualize panel behavior, and explore relationships between environmental factors and energy output.

**Overview**
Loads and inspects cleaned solar data (solar_cleaned.csv).
Visualizes DC Power and Irradiation for individual and multiple panels.
Exports filtered datasets for selected panels.
Generates a DC Power heatmap and applies PCA for module comparison.

**Requirements**
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

**Output**
DC Power time-series plots (all and selected panels)
Irradiation comparison plots
Heatmap of DC Power (by time and panel)
PCA visualization of panel performance
Exported CSV files with filtered data
